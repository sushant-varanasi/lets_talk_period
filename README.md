#OUR IDEA

India is a country which is home to many myths and taboos.
Shattering the glass ceiling is the requirement of the hour if
we were to succeed as a nation.

One such taboo is that of MENSTRUATION.

Women around the world are still looked down upon if they
are seen talking about the same.

As discussed earlier, our idea was to increase familiarity
towards Menstruation and general awareness about the
topic.


#THE SOLUTION.

A step has been taken in that direction; we have come up
with a website which allows one to share their thoughts and
ideas through blogs and also attend webinars which will
increase their self confidence.

These two components of the website will make sure that we
normalizes Menstruation and give a platform to women to
discuss their problems and share their experiences.


#THE IMPACT.

Many girls and women are subject to restrictions in their
daily lives simply because they are menstruating. Not
entering the “puja” room is the major restriction among
urban girls whereas, not entering the kitchen is the main
restriction among the rural girls during menstruation.
Menstruating girls and women are also restricted from
offering prayers and touching holy books. The underlying
basis for this myth is also the cultural beliefs of impurity
associated with menstruation. It is further believed that
menstruating women are unhygienic and unclean and hence
the food they prepare or handle can get contaminated.

#NO SCIENCE CAN EXPLAIN THESE MYTHS.

#THE CHANGE IS ON IT’S WAY, WE JUST HELPED CREAT A
PATHWAY.
